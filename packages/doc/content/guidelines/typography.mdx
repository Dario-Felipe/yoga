## Typography

Inter is a font crafted & designed for screens. Is the main font used in Yoga because it can support long texts and information hierarchy to ensure good user experiences. It works for most things, like headings and body.

NaN Holo is used when we want to highlight, especially our brand, but also titles and feedback, for example. NaN Holo is used in our wow moments, so it shouldn't be used in long texts.
