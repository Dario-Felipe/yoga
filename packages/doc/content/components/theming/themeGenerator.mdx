import { Link as GatsbyLink } from 'gatsby';

## Theme Generator 

Yoga exposes a function that let you create your very own theme which can later be injected into <GatsbyLink to="/components/theming/themeProvider">`<ThemeProvider>`</GatsbyLink>.
You can refer to <GatsbyLink to="/components/theming/theme">Theme</GatsbyLink> in order to see our theme object schema.

### Live Demo
There is also a [CodeSandbox project](https://codesandbox.io/s/theming-in-yoga-rh4th) containing a minimal demo of all this concept in action as a practical reference. Feel free to report any issues, suggestions or even submiting pull requests in our [repository](https://github.com/gympas/yoga).

### Usage

This is a simple usage:

```javascript type=highlight
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { createTheme, ThemeProvider, Button } from '@gympass/yoga';

const theme = createTheme((tokens) => ({
  colors: {
    primary: tokens.colors.deepPurple,
  }
}));

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <Button>Hey! I'm themed!</Theme>
</ThemeProvider>
```
