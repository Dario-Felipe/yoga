By default all Theme components use the default theme. You can extend and customize theme on top level with ThemeProvider or on individual component level with theme override.

## Colors

consistent experiences and meaningful expressions in our products.

titles and texts.

```

<ThemeFonts />

## Font-Sizes


Font sizes define the size of a typography and its content hierarchy to be semantic and consistent.

```javascript type=highlight

## Spacing

Spacing system is vast and comprehensive. There are 10 predefined padding sizes.

## Borders

A border is a visual attribute that you can apply to a shape. We use three kinds
of borders to differentiate elements.

## Elevations

Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.
It brings additional hierarchy to the design and is used mainly to emphasise
interaction states. Elevation is represented with shadows cast by surfaces.
Shadows can be either one-color only (shades of grey with variable opacity) or,
in special cases (like images) it can mimic the image content (see streaming
app light theme templates).

```javascript type=highlight
theme.elevations
```

<ThemeElevations />

## Shapes (Radii)

Surfaces can be displayed in different shapes. Shapes direct attention,
identify components, communicate state and express brand.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.radii
```

<ThemeShape />
