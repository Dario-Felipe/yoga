# Theming

By default all Theme components use the default theme. You can extend and customize theme on top level with ThemeProvider or on individual component level with theme override.

## ThemeProvider

ThemeProvider component extends from styled-component `ThemeProvider`, you can
check it out [here.](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#theming)
Our component adds some extra features to `ThemeProvider` like global and
specific locale design-tokens merge.

### Usage

An important point in using it is that your whole application **must** be
wrapped in our `ThemeProvider` component:

```javascript type=highlight
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@gympass/yoga';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>Find an activity</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Colors

Gympass theme colors can distinguishes our brand and helps us to create
consistent experiences and meaningful expressions in our products.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.colors
```

<ThemeColors />

## Fonts

Fonts can define our brand and the way we express ourselves through
titles and texts.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.fonts
```

<ThemeFonts />

## Font-Sizes


Font sizes define the size of a typography and its content hierarchy to be semantic and consistent.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.fontSizes
```

<ThemeFontSizes />

## Font-Weights

Font Weights define the weight of a typography to express relevance.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.fontWeights
```

<ThemeFontWeights />

## Line-Heights

Line heights refers to the height of a typography and it indicates how tall or
short each glyph in a typeface will be.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.lineHeights
```

<ThemeLineHeights />

## Breakpoints

A breakpoint maps the screen size with its layout requirements.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.breakpoints
```

<ThemeBreakpoints />

## Spacing

Spacing system is vast and comprehensive. There are 10 predefined padding sizes.
In specific cases, when a huge gap is needed those values can be summed up.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.spacing
```

<ThemeSpacing />

## Borders

A border is a visual attribute that you can apply to a shape. We use three kinds
of borders to differentiate elements.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.borders
```

<ThemeBorders />

## Elevations

Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.
It brings additional hierarchy to the design and is used mainly to emphasise
interaction states. Elevation is represented with shadows cast by surfaces.
Shadows can be either one-color only (shades of grey with variable opacity) or,
in special cases (like images) it can mimic the image content (see streaming
app light theme templates).

```javascript type=highlight
theme.elevations
```

<ThemeElevations />

## Shapes (Radii)

Surfaces can be displayed in different shapes. Shapes direct attention,
identify components, communicate state and express brand.

```javascript type=highlight
theme.radii
```

<ThemeShape />
