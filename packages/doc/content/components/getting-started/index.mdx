## Getting Started

Gympass design-system's follows design guidelines specification, we developed a React and React Native UI library that contains a set of high quality components that defines our interfaces.

An important note is that the **styled-components** is a peerDependency [see why](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#i-am-a-library-author-should-i-bundle-styledcomponents-with-my-library), if you dont have styled-components installed you'll [need to install](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation).

### Installing

In order to install our design-system just run:

```bash type=highlight
yarn add @gympass/yoga

// or

npm install @gympass/yoga
```

### Usage

An important point in using it is that your whole application must be wrapped in our `ThemeProvider` component:

```javascript type=highlight
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@gympass/yoga';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button>Find an activity</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
### Adding Gympass font in your project

Both iOS and Android come with their own set of platform fonts but all Yoga
components needs its own font family based on
[font design token](https://gympass.github.io/yoga/guidelines/tokens/fonts).

#### React Native > 0.60

Edit or create the file `react-native.config.js` in your project's root to be as
follows:

```javascript type=highlight
module.exports = {
  project: {
    ios: {},
    android: {},
  },
  assets: ['./node_modules/@gympass/yoga/fonts'],
};
```

and run the command bellow:

```javascript type=highlight
react-native link
```

#### React Native < 0.60
