## Getting Started

Gympass design-system's follows design guidelines specification, we developed a React and React Native UI library that contains a set of high quality components that defines our interfaces.

An important note is that the **styled-components** is a peerDependency [see why](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#i-am-a-library-author-should-i-bundle-styledcomponents-with-my-library), if you dont have styled-components installed you'll [need to install](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation).
