### Peer dependencies

⚠️ Depending on your package manager and its version, it is possible that it automatically install these `peerDependencies`, making step unnecessary.

In order to have Yoga working in your application, you'll need some peer dependencies:

[@react-native-picker](https://github.com/react-native-picker/picker): Used in our mobile version of the Dropdown component

[react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg): Used for our Icons.


```bash type=highlight
yarn add @react-native-picker/picker react-native-svg
```

### Adding Gympass font in your project

Both iOS and Android come with their own set of platform fonts but all Yoga
components needs its own font family based on
